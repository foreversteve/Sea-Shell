//readline, parseline, fork, wait for execution, parse next line.
	// count the number of tokens before parsing, all tokens separated by single space
	// Read and separate multiple commands on one line with ";"

// Write the cd and exit function (use chdir())

// - This will be explained in class after Thanksgiving. 
// Implement simple redirection using > (redirecting stdout) and < (redirecting stdin). 
// Implement simple pipes: ls | wc would run ls and use the output from ls as the input for wc. 
	// • You can restrict the locations and ordering of > and <. 
	// • You can limit piping (|) to a single pipe.

// FUNCTION HEADER FOR ALL

// You should have a readme file with the following:
// A description of what features your shell implements
// A description of what features you attempted to implement but were unsuccessful
// Any bugs or things you want me to know about your program
// I am much more forgiving of reported bugs than bugs I discover while testing
// A copy of every function header
// An example of the readme file can be found in the github repository for this assignment
